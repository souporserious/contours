# Contours

This is an example of generating contours from a 2D array using Rust.

## Development

Generate a package that [site](/site) can consume:

```bash
wasm-pack build --target bundler
```

Install `site` dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
cd site
yarn install
yarn dev
```
